jQuery Nearest Element plugin
======

**NOTE: This is a work in progress, these are just some quick notes.**

Method signatures:

 * $.nearest({x, y}, selector) - find $(selector) closest to x/y point on screen
 * $(elem).nearest(selector) - find $(selector) closest to elem
 * $(elemSet).nearest({x, y}) - filter $(elemSet) and return closest to x/y point on screen

Reverse logic:

 * $.furthest()
 * $().furthest()

Intersecting/touching:

 * $.touching()
 * $().touching()
